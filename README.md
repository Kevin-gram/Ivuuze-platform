The idea came about as a result of observing how Community health workers  (C.H.W.s) work in a condition where, at times, they have patients but no enough medications to facilitate them, and this is not because the supply is not good but because there are 4 in one village which means one can be overcrowded. At the same time, the other is still packed with packs of drugs, but no one is reaching out, probably because they can't trace them. Additionally, regarding the new residence of a community for those who are not estate owners who move according to the conditions of life, we asked ourselves how patients can trace C.H.W.s in their new neighborhood. All this came to our minds and made us decide to design a solution that can help C.H.W.s and the community by developing a website-based solution that provides first-hand information about who is seeking help and ensures the interactivity of the patient with the CHW to provide the basic treatment of some specific diseases.
This solution was designed to be user-friendly and can provide all information about the community health workers in place when they're free as they have other responsibilities besides treating people in their free time. In addition, the patient can get where the C.H.W. is located and what they have. The platform will also offer essential first-aid solutions on the first-aid page, where there will be emergency numbers and addresses of the nearest hospitals as well as government officials.
